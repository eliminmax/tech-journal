# Windows 10: IPv4 Settings

To access the IPv4 Settings, do the following as an administrator:

0. In Control Panel, navigate to `Control Panel > Network and Internet > Network and Sharing Center`, and click on the connection you want to configure.

1. In the `<Connection> Status` popup, click **Properties**.

2. In the `<Connection> Properties` popup, click the `Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)` item, then click **Properties**.

From here, you can set a manual IP address, or switch back to DHCP. If you are using DHCP, you can still manually choose a DNS server.
