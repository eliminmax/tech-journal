# Remoting through the Remote Server Administration Tool

To access Powershell from a different Windows server, add the Active Directory for Windows Powershell Remote Server Administration Tool (Add Roles and Features - `Features > Remote Server Administration Tools > Role Administration Tools > AD DS and AD LDS Tools > Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell`), and once installed/enabled, you'll be able to access PowerShell on another device by right clicking it on the "All Servers" page.
