# Tech Journal

This is a successor to the tech journal I kept while working towards my degree in Computer Networking and Cybersecurity at Champlain College. I had to keep that journal in a GitHub wiki, and it included reflections on specific assignments that I no longer have any need for. The old journal is archived, and available [here](https://github.com/eliminmax/cncs-journal/wiki), but I've copied the more generally applicable parts of it into this repository.

I host a version of this tech journal, rendered with `mkdocs`, at [tech-docs.earrayminkoff.tech](https://tech-docs.earrayminkoff.tech/).
